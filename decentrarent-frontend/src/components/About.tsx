      <h1>About DecentraRent</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>DecentraRent</strong> is a decentralized smart contract-based rental platform built to bring transparency,
        efficiency, and trust to the rental market. Powered by blockchain technology, DecentraRent allows landlords and
        tenants to connect directly, automate lease agreements, and handle rent payments through secure crypto transactions.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to revolutionize the rental process by eliminating the middlemen and centralized systems that often cause delays,
        disputes, and lack of transparency. By leveraging Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, DecentraRent ensures all terms
        are enforceable and all transactions are traceable.
